# Folder Organizer Pro

A small cross-platform GUI application for quickly creating common folders.

## Features
- Create preset folders like Gaming, School, Work and Projects.
- Optionally create a custom folder.
- Progress bar feedback during creation.
- Written with [customtkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter).

## Usage
Run the application with Python 3:

```bash
python main.py
```

You will be prompted to pick a target directory and choose the folder preset.

## Development
This repository is intentionally lightweight. Image assets for the GUI are
stored in the `Assets/` directory and the main logic lives inside the
`logic` and `gui` packages.
